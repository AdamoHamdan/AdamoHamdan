# About Me:
The names Adam Hamdan and I am a student majoring in Computer Science (Bachelor's of Arts). Ever since I was young, I have picked up the enjoyment of video games, starting with a Nitendo 64 when I was just five. Since then, I began to feel truly hooked to the use of technology, which lead to be getting hooked towards newer things with each passing year like the iPod, iPad, Xbox, and etc. This love and strong hobby for videogames led me to wanting to pursue a future career in Computer Science. I originally aimed for a possible dream career in any field of game design, something that alligned with my childhood hobby, but with learning new programming languages (primarily Java and Python) I would love to pursue some form of software engineering job. Though while im hear getting my major at Wright State University, I will always do what it takes to pursue my academic goals and my major, and keep learning more and more about the computer science and programming world!
# Two Projects I am doing this semester (Note: I haven't gotten information for these projects yet. Will add when changed)
- CS1181) Genetic Algorithm: A Java-based project focusing on the important uses of Object-Oriented programming and Classes to create a genetic-algorithm system for collecting data. Key OOP features such as inheritance, abstracts, and more will be implemented in this project
- CS1181) GUI Based Game: A Java-based project focusing on the use Graphical-User Interfaces to create a code that programs a game that uses these GUI features
## (More to come in this page in the future...)
